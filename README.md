# Tic-Tac-Toe

I created an AI for tic tac toe that cannot lose.  

It is a single page, with a custom CSS and JS page included.  3rd party tools used include jQuery, Bootstrap, and Sublime Text Editor.

The Player will always go first.

You can choose to use Xs or Os, the AI will take the other (you can change mid-game, if you like).

The orange color used for the grid is an homage to the University of Tennessee (GO VOLS!).

## How to Play:

**1.** Download .zip or clone the branch.

**2.** Open index.html in any modern browser.
